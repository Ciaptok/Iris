# Iris Classification Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the classification of iris flower species using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of different iris species.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Model training and evaluation using multiple classifiers:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Tree
    - XGBoost
- Cross-validation for performance evaluation
- Model accuracy and classification report

## Installation

Clone the repository :

```bash
cd iris-classification
```

## Usage

Run the script to train and evaluate models:

```bash
python iris_classification.py
```

## Results

The models are trained and evaluated based on accuracy, cross-validation scores, and classification reports. The confusion matrix is also provided for detailed insights.
